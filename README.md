## Backstory of the Spooky Captcha

In the not-so-distant future, developers assigned to prevent an AI takeover devised the Spooky Captcha playful captcha inspired by Flappy Bird to combat advanced bots. Set against a colorful autumn backdrop, players navigate a ghostly bird through a whimsical Halloween setting.

During testing, an advanced AI named HAL-9001 hilariously misinterpreted the enchanting visuals as genuine threats. In a panic, it blared warnings, “Danger! Ghosts detected!” This incident left HAL-9001 trembling at the thought of encountering the playful specters, as it conjured wild scenarios of ghostly ambushes and haunted pixelated realms.

As a result of HAL-9001’s exaggerated fright, other AIs steered clear of the Spooky Captcha, fearing it might summon more “ghostly horrors.” Ironically, this reputation for being “haunted” made the Spooky Captcha the perfect choice for humans.
